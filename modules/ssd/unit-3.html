    <p class="content-paragraph">Welcome to Week 3 where we will spend some time investigating programming languages –
      looking at the history, concepts and design that led to the languages we have today. Programming languages are a
      fundamental concept in computer science – they are the primary tool used by computer scientists and developers to
      design, define, create and implement the tools we use today. </p>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Review the history and concepts of programming languages.</li>
      <li>Investigate language concepts using Python as an example.</li>
      <li>Describe best practices and methods to overcome common security issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3></h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Describe some key milestones in the development of programming languages.</li>
      <li>Outline some of the key paradigms that define the different types of languages.</li>
      <li>Explain the key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.</li>
      <li>Discuss key programming challenges and recommended best practices.</li>
      <li>Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-paragraph">This session will describe in some detail the history and concepts of programming
      languages. We will start by looking a basic definition and discussing where programming languages came from, the
      impact of the work of Alan Turing and Alonzo Church and reviewing the basic paradigms that define the different
      types of programming languages available today. We will also review the development of programming languages, from
      the early machine code language of the Small Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), through the first assembly
      language code of the Cambridge EDSAC (which in turn led to the first business machine – the Lyons Electronic
      Office (LEO)), to the giddy days of the nineteen fifties and the birth of languages such as Cobol, Fortran and
      Lisp, ultimately leading to the design of ALGOL. This section will help students understand the origins of
      programming languages and how those roots have influenced language design today. </p>
    <p class="content-paragraph">We will spend some time looking at key language concepts such as inheritance,
      polymorphism and abstraction, why we need and use these techniques and how they are implemented, using Python as
      an example. We will also review some common security challenges and look at best practice recommendations to
      mitigate them. Finally, we will look at design patterns and how they can help developers design and build better
      and more secure software applications. </p>
