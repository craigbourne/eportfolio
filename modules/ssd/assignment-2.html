    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p class="content-paragraph"> This assignment involves an individual assessment which must be submitted by end of
      unit 11. </p>
    <p class="content-paragraph">This assignment accounts for 40% of your total module mark. Remember to save a copy of
      the final development to your GitHub repositories. The word count is 1,500 words. </p>
    <h3>The Coding Output </h3>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Carrying on from the Full Brief provided in Unit 6, this assignment focuses on the
      second deliverable, a practical development of your design from Unit 6. </p>
    <p class="content-paragraph">The code should be developed using Python within any IDE. You should submit a fully tested code set. Code should be organised and documented according to Python's PEP-8 style guide (van Rossum, 2001). You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how the various aspects of the system work. Your code should also be tested and the evidence of this provided. Testing should be supported using unit tests which you have written, in addition to the use of linters. You should submit a README file that documents how the application can be run. </p>
    <p class="content-paragraph">The final submission builds on the work which you demonstrated during the seminars.
    </p>
    <h3>Submission Checklist</h3>
    <ul class="reference-list">
      <li>You should submit a fully tested set of code with all required libraries. Code should be well documented with
        in-line commentary. </li>
      <li>You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating operation of the key functionality of your code via
        demos, screenshots and output captures. </li>
      <li>You should include comprehensive evidence of testing including output from test tools (such as linters)
        demonstrating correct code, security, and functional testing with any remediation activity documented as well.
      </li>
      <li>You should submit a README file that documents how the application can be run. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Note that the grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be
      reviewed alongside the criteria grid (available in the Module Resources section). </p>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Note that academic integrity applies to the demonstrations as mentioned above, and your
      codes, where all sources can be placed in the README file and/or as part of the code commentary. </p>
    <h3>The code development will be assessed according to: </h3>
    <ul class="reference-list">
      <li>Knowledge and understanding of the topic/issues under consideration (30%). <div> - Suitability of the security
          mechanisms deployed for the attack surface of the domain.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Application of knowledge and understanding (30%). <div> - Implementation of the secure mechanisms in Python.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Structure and presentation (30%). <div> - Adherence to object-oriented coding practices.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Academic integrity (10%). <div> - Reference(s) made to support design decisions. Accurate spelling, grammar,
          and punctuation in supporting documentation.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Please note that appendices should not be used to extend the core report as reports
      should be stand alone, complete, and concise, without any appendices. This module also assesses your ability to
      express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity. </p>
    <h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Design and develop/adapt computer programs and to produce a solution that meets the design brief and
        critically evaluate solutions that are produced.</li>
    </ul>
