      <p class="content-paragraph">Hi Ioannis,</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Thank you for your analysis of insecure design and the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">I found your perspective on the cinema booking system vulnerability interesting. Your use of flowcharts to illustrate both the insecure design and the proposed solution is particularly effective.</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">What I like about your flowcharts:</p>
      <ol class="content-list">
        <li>Clarity: Both diagrams cleanly depict the booking process, clearly illustrating the vulnerability where bad actors can make free reservations for fewer than 15 tickets without a deposit.</li>
        <li>Colour-coding: The use of red to highlight the vulnerable path and green for the safeguard aids quick comprehension.</li>
        <li>Comparison: Presenting both versions side-by-side allows for easy comparison and highlights the specific change addressing the vulnerability.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Potential improvements:</p>
      <ol class="content-list">
        <li>Additional detail: Whilst implementing a deposit is a good start, you could explore additional security measures for a more robust solution: <ul>
            <div>- Rate limiting: Restrict the number of bookings a user can make within a certain timeframe, preventing rapid-fire false reservations.</div>
            <div>- User verification: Implement steps to verify user identity, especially for new accounts or unusual booking patterns, to ensure legitimacy.</div>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>System context: Adding a brief overview of the entire booking system could provide more context, helping readers understand where this process fits within the larger application.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Your discussion on the importance of threat modelling and using UML diagrams for identifying vulnerabilities is great. It would be interesting to see how you might apply these principles to other potential vulnerabilities in the cinema booking system, such as data privacy or payment processing. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Overall, your post effectively demonstrates the importance of secure design in software development. </p>

    <h3 id="unit-2-peer-response-2">Peer Response 2 to Lauren Pechey</h3>
    <div class="answer">
      <a target="_black" href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=245813">Please find Lauren's post here (Must be logged in to UoEO)</a>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Hi Lauren, </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Thank you for your excellent analysis of Broken Access Control and its position as the top vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">I found your perspective on the admin panel vulnerability particularly insightful. Your use of sequence diagrams to illustrate the vulnerable system and the proposed solution is highly effective. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">What I like about your sequence diagrams: </p>
      <ol class="content-list">
        <li>Clarity: Both diagrams depict the interaction between users and the system, making it easy to understand the vulnerability and its resolution.</li>
        <li>Comparison: Presenting both the vulnerable and secure versions allows for easy comparison and highlights the specific changes that address the broken access control issue.</li>
        <li>Real-world applicability: Your example of simply adding "/admin" to a URL is a practical and relatable scenario, effectively illustrating how easily broken access control issues can occur.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Potential improvements:</p>
      <ol class="content-list">
        <li>While implementing proper authentication and authorisation is crucial, you could explore additional security measures for a more robust solution: <div>- Multi-factor authentication: Implement an extra layer of security for admin access.</div>
          <div>- Principle of least privilege: Ensure admin accounts have only the necessary permissions, minimising potential damage if compromised.</div>
        </li>
        <li>Error handling: I appreciate that you've mentioned logging attempts by non-admin users to access the admin panel. It might be valuable to visually represent this in your secure version diagram, showing how the system responds to and logs unauthorised access attempts. This could further demonstrate the proper logging and alert mechanisms you've described.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Your discussion on the importance of strong authentication mechanisms and proper access controls is excellent. It would be interesting to see how you might apply these principles to other potential vulnerabilities in web applications, such as API security or session management.</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Overall, your post effectively demonstrates the critical nature of access control in secure software development.</p>

      <h3>Mitigating Internal Cyber Threats: A Human-Centric Approach</h3>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security. As highlighted by Mimecast (2024), human risk remains a largely unaddressed cybersecurity gap. To effectively manage this internal threat, organisations must adopt a comprehensive strategy that leverages key concepts from the ISO/IEC 27000 standard. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Firstly, implementing robust authentication (ISO/IEC 27000, 2018, 3.5) protocols is crucial. By ensuring that only authorised individuals can access sensitive systems and data, organisations can significantly reduce the risk of insider threats. This approach should be complemented by regular risk assessment (3.61) practices, which enable the identification and evaluation of potential vulnerabilities arising from human interactions with systems. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Furthermore, fostering a culture of 'information security awareness (3.28) is paramount. This involves educating employees about the importance of cybersecurity and their role in maintaining it. Regular training sessions and awareness programmes can equip staff with the knowledge to recognise and respond to potential threats, thereby transforming them from potential liabilities into active defenders of organisational security. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">The implementation of comprehensive monitoring (3.46) systems is another critical aspect. By observing user activities and system interactions, organisations can detect anomalous behaviours that may indicate a security breach or attempted attack. However, this must be balanced with respect for employee privacy and adherence to relevant legal frameworks. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Finally, establishing an effective information security incident management (3.32) process is essential. This ensures that when security incidents occur – whether through malicious intent or human error – they are swiftly identified, contained, and resolved. A well-structured incident response plan can significantly mitigate the potential damage of security breaches. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">By integrating these five elements – authentication, risk assessment, information security awareness, monitoring, and incident management – organisations can create a framework for managing internal cybersecurity risks. This approach acknowledges the central role of people in cybersecurity while providing the necessary safeguards and processes to mitigate potential threats. </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">As emphasised by Labunets et al. (2023), the reuse of security knowledge, such as these standardised concepts, can significantly enhance an organisation's ability to conduct effective security risk analysis. By adopting this human-centric approach to cybersecurity, organisations can transform their biggest potential vulnerability – people – into their most effective line of defence. </p>
