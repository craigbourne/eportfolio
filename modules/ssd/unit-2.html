    <h3>Module overview</h3>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Welcome to Week 2, during which we will gain some practical skills regarding the creation of flow charts. These are used during the design stage of the SDLC and can be used from that point onwards to support communications between stakeholders. </p>
    <h3>In this unit we shall:</h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Gain an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC.</li>
      <li>Experiment with the creation of UML flow charts.</li>
      <li>Understand the range of ways in which software security can be problematic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>On completion of this unit you will be able to: </h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Research the academic literature on software development which follows an agile process and prioritises security.</li>
      <li>Break down the steps involved in a process so that they may be represented as a flow chart.</li>
      <li>Reading areas of an ISO/IEC Standard on security and becoming familiar with the language and concepts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-paragraph">In this week, you will get hands on experience with creating a UML model, presented from the perspective of the weakness(es) in a piece of software that can lead to a security breach occurring. This is important from the perspective of the summative assessment in the sense that the UML models which you create will be used to support communication between the team members in your group. </p>
