    <h3>Module Overview</h3>
    <p class="content-paragraph">Welcome to Week 10, in which we will consider the variety of system architectures which
      exist today, from monolithic deployments to microservices, virtualisation, and containers. We will gain an
      appreciation of the reasons why the architectures have evolved in the manner that they have and recognise the
      security problems which can become problematic in each. As we have increasingly moved towards more distributed
      modes of operation, the surface which can be attacked increases. Intelligent techniques to protect the data that
      is being transported across these systems is needed, further increasing the drive for system security. </p>
    <h3>In this unit we shall: </h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Explore the evolution of system architectures, from distributed systems to microservices.</li>
      <li>Examine the strengths and weaknesses of the variety of approaches to distributed systems.</li>
      <li>Define the security attacks which are specific to virtual environments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> On completion of this unit you will be able to: </h3>
    <ul class="content-list">
      <li>Describe a variety of distributed systems, and the pattern in which they evolved.</li>
      <li>Discuss the security attacks that distributed systems, in particular, are vulnerable to.</li>
      <li>Understand the ways in which virtual systems need to be protected due to the specific nature of attacks on
        them. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-paragraph">The content this week continues to examine the importance of developing secure
      software, this time from the perspective of distributed systems and the specific challenges which come from
      operating in a remote manner. Security techniques are therefore expanded this week through the consideration of
      encryption, for example, and the patterns used to distribute encryption keys, in addition to the nature of attacks
      that are specific to virtualised environments. This week helps to bring the module content to a more timely and
      relevant mode of operation, that of being distributed. </p>
