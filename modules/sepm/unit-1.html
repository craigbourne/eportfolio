    <h3>Unit Work</h3>
    <div class="unit-work">
      <h3>Team project - Synputer Project</h3>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Teams for the group project were assigned and I was paired with Georgia, Shraddha and
        Tinashe. Our initial task was to arrange our first meeting and agree a <a class="regular-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gCHzr61NgdAZ86sgY61bdFg__v5FJZnaHc-zJbT6ZtE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">team
          contract</a> to decide our roles and responsibilities within the team. <a class="regular-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18i_CmbDlSES3wedgGXi8ogjcz9XBUq8C6jyCFzHFFM0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Meeting notes can be viewed here</a>.</p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">We were also asked to familiarise ourselves with the core materials for the group project, which included a <a class="regular-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xa7qi-z66xJnHpVbtVj7U456oBgtM_zH?usp=sharing" target="_blank">case study and two appendices.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Discussion post</h3>
      <p class="content-paragraph">We were also asked to make our first contributions to a collaborative discussion that would last the duration of units 1, 2 and 3. The task was to read Agrawal et al. (2024) from the required reading and answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul class="work-list">
        <li>1. What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?</li>
        <li>2. Give two examples of failures that support your choices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Below is a screenshot of my post in the forum and <a class="regular-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pjxk9tIdgAGSF0w2OfChbknN8XokKAa_NjjWJOqxhEU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the full post can be read here</a>.</p>
