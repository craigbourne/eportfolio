    <h2 class="content-heading">Unit 9: Quality Management Strategy</h2>
    <p class="content-paragraph">In unit 9, we learned about the variety of ways through which software quality may be determined to have been achieved. We examined effective quality management of a software and explored a variety of metrics by which software quality may be measured. When testing a software development and preparing for delivery of software to a client, there will be a need to demonstrate that the functional and non-functional requirements of the system have been fulfilled.</p>

      <h3> Improving Code Quality </h3>
      <p class="content-paragraph">This unit's only formative task required us to refer to Anaya (2021), and apply at least three of the strategies presented at the source to improve the quality of some Python code.
      </p>
      <p class="content-paragraph">Unfortunately, the resource is unavailable in both physical and digital form from the University of Essex library:</p>
      <img src="../../images/anaya.jpeg" alt="Anaya unavailable">
      <p class="content-paragraph">This was particularly frustrating, and as a result there was no way of knowing what strategies were included in the text that could have improved code quality. Therefore, the task could not be completed. I will attempt to find a copy and return to complete this task at a later date.</p>
